        <p className="text-base font-sans font-light text-left mb-4">
          Ciao, I'm <span className="font-bold">Davide Condoluci</span> and I
          recently completed the Web Application & Apps course at Scuola Mohole,
          where I gained solid skills as a frontend developer and graphic
          designer. I love working in teams, and have strong critical thinking.
          Precision is one of my strengths, which I apply to every project.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base font-sans font-light text-left mb-12">
          My passions range from sports, like soccer, gym, and running, to
          fashion, technology, and collecting. I also love traveling and
          discovering new cultures, which inspire and enrich my creativity. This
          mix of interests allows me to bring a unique and creative perspective
          to everything I do. I am always looking for new challenges and
          opportunities to grow and learn, both professionally and personally.
