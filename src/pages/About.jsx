          </h1>

            Ciao, I'm Davide Condoluci and I recently completed the Web
            Application & Apps course at Scuola Mohole, where I gained solid
            skills as a frontend developer and graphic designer. I love working
            in teams, and have strong critical thinking. Precision is one of my
            strengths, which I apply to every project.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-left">
            My passions range from sports, like soccer, gym, and running, to
            fashion, technology, and collecting. I also love traveling and
            discovering new cultures, which inspire and enrich my creativity.
            This mix of interests allows me to bring a unique and creative
            perspective to everything I do. I am always looking for new
            challenges and opportunities to grow and learn, both professionally
            and personally.
          </p>
